### 2.2. Install and Configure Standard-Version for Versioning

Standard-Version is a utility for versioning using `semver` and CHANGELOG generation powered by Conventional Commits.

Here is how you can install and configure it:

1. **Install Standard-Version:** You can add Standard-Version as a devDependency in your `package.json` using npm. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm i --save-dev standard-version
   ```
2. **Configure npm scripts:** In your `package.json` file, add a `release` script in the `scripts` section:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "release": "standard-version"
   }
   ```
3. **Generate CHANGELOG and tag release:** Now, when you're ready to make a new version, you can run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run release
   ```
   This command will generate/ update your CHANGELOG, create a new version based on your commit history, and create a new git tag.

For more detailed configuration options, you can refer to the [official Standard-Version documentation](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version#readme).
