To import the necessary libraries and packages in the SLAM node, add the following lines of code at the beginning of your source code file:

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

# Import other required packages and message types
# For example:
# from sensor_msgs.msg import LaserScan
# from nav_msgs.msg import Odometry
# ...
```

Make sure to replace the commented lines with the actual import statements for the specific packages and message types you need in your SLAM node. These imports will provide access to the required functionality and message types for implementing SLAM algorithms and processing sensor data.
