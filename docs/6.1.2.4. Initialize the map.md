To initialize the map in the SLAM node, you need to create a data structure to store the map information. The specific implementation may vary depending on the SLAM algorithm you are using. Here's an example of how you can initialize the map in C++:

```cpp
#include <rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp>

class SlamNode : public rclcpp::Node
{
public:
  SlamNode() : Node("slam_node")
  {
    // Initialize the map
    initializeMap();
    
    // Rest of the SLAM node code...
  }
  
private:
  void initializeMap()
  {
    // Create a data structure to store the map
    // Initialize the map with default values or empty cells
    
    // Add your map initialization code here
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
  auto node = std::make_shared<SlamNode>();
  rclcpp::spin(node);
  rclcpp::shutdown();
  return 0;
}
```

In this code snippet, the `initializeMap()` function is called within the `SlamNode` constructor to initialize the map. Inside the `initializeMap()` function, you can create a data structure (e.g., grid map, occupancy map) to represent the map and initialize it with default values or empty cells.

The specific implementation of the map data structure depends on the SLAM algorithm you are using. For example, if you are using a grid map, you can create a 2D array or matrix to represent the grid cells and initialize them with default values. If you are using an occupancy map, you can create a probabilistic data structure (e.g., log-odds) to represent the occupancy probabilities of the map cells.

Modify the code according to your specific map data structure and initialization requirements. Remember to include the necessary headers and implement the map initialization code based on the SLAM algorithm you are using.
