3.1. Pull ROS2 Docker Image
To use ROS2 within a Docker container, you need to pull the ROS2 Docker image from the Docker Hub repository. Follow the steps below to pull the ROS2 Docker image:

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt.**

2. **Run the following command to pull the latest ROS2 Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker pull ros:humble
    ```
    This command pulls the ROS2 Humble Fitzroy image from the Docker Hub. You can replace humble with the desired ROS2 version (e.g., galactic, rolling) if you prefer a different version.

3. **Wait for the Docker image to be downloaded. The download progress will be displayed in the terminal.**

    Once the download is complete, you will have the ROS2 Docker image available locally on your machine. You can use this image to create and run ROS2 containers.

By pulling the ROS2 Docker image, you have obtained the base image that provides the ROS2 environment within a Docker container. You can now proceed to create and run ROS2 containers using this image.
