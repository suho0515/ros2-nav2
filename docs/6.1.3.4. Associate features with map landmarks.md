```cpp
void processExtractedFeatures()
{
  // Implement feature association with map landmarks

  // Iterate through the extracted features
  for (const auto& feature : extracted_features_)
  {
    // Find the closest landmark in the map
    Landmark closest_landmark;
    double closest_distance = std::numeric_limits<double>::max();

    for (const auto& landmark : map_landmarks_)
    {
      // Compute the distance between the feature and the landmark
      double distance = computeDistance(feature, landmark);

      // Update the closest landmark if the distance is smaller
      if (distance < closest_distance)
      {
        closest_landmark = landmark;
        closest_distance = distance;
      }
    }

    // Associate the feature with the closest landmark
    associateFeatureWithLandmark(feature, closest_landmark);
  }
}

void associateFeatureWithLandmark(const Feature& feature, const Landmark& landmark)
{
  // Implement feature association with the landmark
  // Update the landmark's attributes based on the associated feature
}
```

In the code above, the `processExtractedFeatures` function is responsible for associating the extracted features with the corresponding landmarks in the map. It iterates through each extracted feature and finds the closest landmark in the map. The `computeDistance` function calculates the distance between the feature and the landmark. The closest landmark is then associated with the feature using the `associateFeatureWithLandmark` function. Inside the `associateFeatureWithLandmark` function, you can update the attributes of the landmark based on the associated feature.

You can customize the implementation of the `computeDistance` and `associateFeatureWithLandmark` functions based on your specific feature and landmark representations and association criteria.
