# 4.3. Setting up the GPU for gazebo in Windows 11

1. Install NVIDIA Driver: Ensure that you have installed the latest NVIDIA driver for your GPU. Visit the NVIDIA website (https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) to download and install the appropriate driver for your GPU model.

2. Enable GPU Support for WSL 2: Open a PowerShell terminal as Administrator and run the following command:

   ```bash
   wsl --set-default-version 2
   ```

   This command sets the default version of WSL to 2.

3. Install CUDA Toolkit: Download and install the CUDA Toolkit from the NVIDIA website. The CUDA Toolkit provides the necessary libraries and tools for GPU acceleration.

4. Configure WSL 2 GPU Support: Open the `.wslconfig` file located in your user directory (usually `C:\Users\<your_username>\.wslconfig`) and add the following lines:

   ```plaintext
   [wsl2]
   kernelCommandLine = vsyscall=emulate
   ```

   Save the file and close it.

5. Restart WSL 2: Open a PowerShell terminal as Administrator and run the following command to restart the WSL 2 services:

   ```bash
   wsl --shutdown
   ```

6. Verify GPU Access: Open a WSL 2 terminal (e.g., Ubuntu) and run the following command to check if the GPU is accessible:

   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```

   If the command shows the GPU details, it means that the GPU is accessible from within the WSL 2 environment.

7. Launch Docker: Open Docker Desktop and start the application. Docker will automatically detect the WSL 2 backend.

8. Run Gazebo with GPU Support: Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to include the necessary GPU settings for the `turtlebot3_simulator` service, as mentioned in the previous response. Then, use the `docker-compose up` command to start the Docker container.

By following these steps, you can configure GPU access for Docker in Windows 11 with WSL 2 and run Gazebo with GPU acceleration.
