# 5. Development Environment Setup

To set up the development environment for your project, follow these steps:

1. Create a `Dockerfile.dev` file in the project root directory.

2. Open the `Dockerfile.dev` file and add the following content:

```Dockerfile
FROM ros2_turtlebot3

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /workspace

# Copy the source code to the container
COPY . /workspace

# Install additional dependencies, if any
RUN /bin/bash -c "apt-get update"
RUN /bin/bash -c "apt-get install -y <additional-packages>"

# Set environment variables, if needed
ENV ENV_VARIABLE=value

# Run any necessary commands, e.g., build the project
RUN /bin/bash -c "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && colcon build"

# Set the default command to launch the development environment
CMD ["bash"]
```

3. Save the `Dockerfile.dev` file.

4. Open the `docker-compose.dev.yaml` file.

5. Modify the `docker-compose.dev.yaml` file as follows:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  turtlebot3_simulator:
    image: ros2_turtlebot3
    environment:
      - DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0
      - LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=0
    command: bash -c "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && \
                      export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle && \
                      ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py"
  development:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    volumes:
      - .:/workspace
    environment:
      - DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0
      - LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=0
    command: bash -c "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && \
                      source /workspace/install/setup.bash && \
                      ros2 run <your_package_name> <your_node_name>"
```

6. Save the `docker-compose.dev.yaml` file.

7. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project root directory (`C:\github\ros2-nav2`).

8. Run the following command to build the development container:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml build
```

9. Once the build is complete, run the following command to start the development environment:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up
```

This will launch the development container and run your ROS2 package inside it. Make sure to replace `<your_package_name>` and `<your_node_name>` with the actual names of your package and node.

10. You can now develop and test your code within the development container. Any changes made to the source code on your local machine will be automatically reflected inside the container.

Note: If you need to install additional dependencies or modify the development environment, you can update the `Dockerfile.dev` and `docker-compose.dev.yaml` files accordingly.

By following these steps, you can set up a development environment using Docker for your ROS2 project.
