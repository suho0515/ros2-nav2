# Install Docker on Windows 11

Follow the steps below to install Docker on Windows 11:

1. **Check system requirements:** Make sure your Windows system supports Docker Desktop. You need to have Windows 11 64-bit: Home, Pro, Enterprise, or Education, version 1903 (Build 18362) or later. Also, your machine must support Hyper-V and SLAT (Second Level Address Translation).

2. **Download Docker Desktop Installer:** Visit the [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/) download page and click on the 'Get Docker' button to download the Docker Desktop Installer.

3. **Run the Installer:** Once the Docker Desktop Installer is downloaded, run the installer. It will guide you through the setup process.

4. **Follow the installation guide:** The installer will ask you if you want to use Windows containers or Linux containers. For this setup, choose Linux containers.

5. **Complete the installation:** After the installation is complete, Docker Desktop will start automatically. You will see a whale icon in the status bar, indicating that Docker is running, and it is ready to use.

6. **Verify the installation:** Open a terminal window and type `docker version`. You should see information about the Docker client and server, which means Docker has been successfully installed.
