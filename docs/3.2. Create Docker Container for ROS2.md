# 3.2. Create Docker Container for ROS2

Once you have pulled the ROS2 Docker image, you can create a Docker container to run ROS2 within an isolated environment. Follow the steps below to create a Docker container for ROS2:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to create a new Docker container from the ROS2 image:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm --name ros2_container ros:humble
   ```

   This command creates a new Docker container named `ros2_container` from the `ros:humble` image. Replace `humble` with the desired ROS2 version if needed.

3. Wait for the container to start. Once the container is running, you will be dropped into a shell session inside the container.

   You are now inside the Docker container, which provides the ROS2 environment. You can execute ROS2 commands and work with ROS2 packages within this container.

   Note that the `--rm` flag in the `docker run` command ensures that the container is automatically removed when you exit the container's shell session. This is useful for temporary testing and experimentation. If you want to keep the container running even after exiting the shell session, remove the `--rm` flag.

4. You can now start using ROS2 within the Docker container. Execute ROS2 commands or work with ROS2 packages as needed.

   For example, you can run the following command to verify that ROS2 is working:

   ```bash
   ros2 topic list
   ```

   This command lists all the available topics in the ROS2 system.

By creating a Docker container for ROS2, you can have an isolated and reproducible environment for developing and running ROS2 applications. You can create multiple containers for different ROS2 projects or configurations, ensuring clean separation and avoiding conflicts between packages.
