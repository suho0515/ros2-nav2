# 4.1. Install Turtlebot3 Packages in Docker using Dockerfile

To install Turtlebot3 packages in Docker, we can create a Dockerfile that specifies the necessary steps to build an image with the required packages. Follow the steps below to create the Dockerfile:

1. Create a new file called `Dockerfile` in your project directory.

2. Open the `Dockerfile` file and add the following content:

```Dockerfile
# Use the base ROS2 image as the starting point
FROM ros:humble

# Install Turtlebot3 packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    ros-humble-turtlebot3 \
    ros-humble-turtlebot3-simulations

# Set the entrypoint command to start a shell session
CMD ["bash"]
```

In the above Dockerfile:
- `FROM ros:humble` specifies the base image as the ROS2 `ros:humble` image.
- `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ...` installs the Turtlebot3 packages using the package manager `apt-get`.
- `CMD ["bash"]` sets the default command to start a shell session when the Docker container is run.

3. Save the `Dockerfile`.

4. Build the Docker image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t ros2_turtlebot3 .
```

The `-t` option sets the image tag to `ros2_turtlebot3`. You can change the tag name as desired.

5. Wait for the Docker image to build. This process may take some time, as it involves downloading and installing the necessary packages.

Once the Docker image is built, it will have the Turtlebot3 packages installed. You can now use this image to create a Docker container and run Turtlebot3 simulations or perform other tasks related to Turtlebot3 in the ROS2 environment.
