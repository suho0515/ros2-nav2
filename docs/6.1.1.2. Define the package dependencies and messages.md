# 6.1.1.2. Define the package dependencies and messages

To define the package dependencies and messages, you need to modify the package manifest (`package.xml`) and the CMakeLists file (`CMakeLists.txt`) of the "slam" package.

First, open the `package.xml` file and add the following lines to specify the package dependencies:

```xml
<buildtool_depend>ament_cmake</buildtool_depend>
<depend>rclcpp</depend>
<depend>sensor_msgs</depend>
```

Next, open the `CMakeLists.txt` file and add the following lines to import the required packages and messages:

```cmake
find_package(ament_cmake REQUIRED)
find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)
find_package(sensor_msgs REQUIRED)

# Add message dependencies
set(msg_deps
  "sensor_msgs"
)

# Generate messages
rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
  ${msg_deps}
)

# Add executables and link dependencies
add_executable(slam_node src/slam_node.cpp)
ament_target_dependencies(slam_node rclcpp ${msg_deps})

# Install executables
install(TARGETS slam_node
  DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME}
)

ament_package()
```

Make sure to place these lines in the appropriate sections of the `CMakeLists.txt` file.

Once you have made these modifications, save the files, and proceed to implement the remaining steps of the SLAM node.

Let me know if you have any further questions!
