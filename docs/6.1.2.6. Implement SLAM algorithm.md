To implement the SLAM algorithm in the SLAM node, you need to incorporate the received sensor data into the mapping process. Here's an example of how you can implement the SLAM algorithm in C++:

```cpp
#include <rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp>
#include <sensor_msgs/msg/SensorData.hpp>

class SlamNode : public rclcpp::Node
{
public:
  SlamNode() : Node("slam_node")
  {
    // Create a subscriber to listen to the sensor topic
    sensor_subscription_ = this->create_subscription<sensor_msgs::msg::SensorData>(
      "sensor_topic", 10, std::bind(&SlamNode::sensorCallback, this, std::placeholders::_1));
      
    // Rest of the SLAM node code...
  }
  
private:
  void sensorCallback(const sensor_msgs::msg::SensorData::SharedPtr msg)
  {
    // Process the received sensor data
    // Update the map based on the sensor data
    updateMap(msg);
    
    // Add your SLAM algorithm code here
    performSLAM();
  }
  
  void updateMap(const sensor_msgs::msg::SensorData::SharedPtr msg)
  {
    // Update the map based on the received sensor data
    // Add your map update code here
  }
  
  void performSLAM()
  {
    // Implement your SLAM algorithm here
    // Update robot pose estimation
    // Perform feature association and mapping
    // Update the map with new landmarks
    
    // Add your SLAM algorithm code here
  }
  
  rclcpp::Subscription<sensor_msgs::msg::SensorData>::SharedPtr sensor_subscription_;
};

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
  auto node = std::make_shared<SlamNode>();
  rclcpp::spin(node);
  rclcpp::shutdown();
  return 0;
}
```

In this code snippet, the `SlamNode` class has a member function `sensorCallback` that is called whenever a new sensor data message is received. Inside the `sensorCallback` function, you can process the received sensor data and update the map using the `updateMap` function. After updating the map, you can then perform the SLAM algorithm in the `performSLAM` function.

Implement your SLAM algorithm inside the `performSLAM` function. This can involve updating the robot pose estimation, performing feature association and mapping, and updating the map with new landmarks. Modify the code according to your specific SLAM algorithm and the sensor data processing requirements.

Remember to incorporate your SLAM algorithm logic and ensure that the map is updated accordingly based on the received sensor data.
