### 2.4. Install and Configure Commitlint for Commit Conventions

Commitlint is a tool that helps enforce commit message conventions. It ensures that commit messages follow a consistent format and style, making it easier to understand the changes made in a commit.

Here is how you can install and configure Commitlint:

1. **Install Commitlint:** You can add Commitlint as a devDependency in your `package.json` using npm. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm i --save-dev @commitlint/cli
2. **Configure Commitlint:** In your project's root directory, create a commitlint.config.js file and define your commit message rules. For example, you can use the conventional commit format:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional']
   };
   ```
   This configuration uses the config-conventional preset, which enforces the conventional commit format, including type, scope, and subject.

3. **Commit with Commitlint:** Now, when you make a commit, Commitlint will check the commit message against the defined rules. If the commit message doesn't meet the specified conventions, Commitlint will throw an error and prevent the commit.

For more detailed configuration options and customization, you can refer to the official Commitlint documentation.
