### 2.3. Install and Configure Husky for Git Hooks

Husky is a tool that makes git hooks easy. Git hooks are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a Git repository.

Here is how you can install and configure Husky:

1. **Install Husky:** You can add Husky as a devDependency in your `package.json` using npm. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm i --save-dev husky
   ```
   Configure Husky: In your package.json file, you can add a husky section to define your hooks. For example, you can add a pre-commit hook that runs your tests before every commit:
   ```json
   "husky": {
     "hooks": {
       "pre-commit": "npm test",
       "pre-push": "npm test",
       "...": "..."
     }
   }
   ```
You can define various hooks such as pre-commit, pre-push, post-merge, etc. and specify the commands or scripts to run.
For more detailed configuration options and available hooks, you can refer to the official Husky documentation.
