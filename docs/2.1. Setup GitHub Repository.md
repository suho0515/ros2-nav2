### 2.1. Setup GitHub Repository

Setting up a GitHub repository involves creating a new repository on GitHub and then cloning it to your local machine. Here are the steps:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:** Go to GitHub and log in to your account. Click on the '+' button in the upper right corner and select 'New repository'. Give your repository a name, choose whether it should be public or private, and click 'Create repository'.

2. **Clone the repository to your local machine:** Open a terminal on your local machine and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Then, run the following command (replace 'your-username' and 'your-repository' with your GitHub username and the name of your repository):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
3. **Navigate into your local repository:** Use the following command to navigate into the local copy of your repository:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```
Now, you can start adding files, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
