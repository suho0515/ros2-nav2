To subscribe to sensor data in the SLAM node, you need to create a subscriber that listens to the sensor topic and receives the sensor data. Here's an example of how you can subscribe to sensor data in C++:

```cpp
#include <rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp>
#include <sensor_msgs/msg/SensorData.hpp>

class SlamNode : public rclcpp::Node
{
public:
  SlamNode() : Node("slam_node")
  {
    // Create a subscriber to listen to the sensor topic
    sensor_subscription_ = this->create_subscription<sensor_msgs::msg::SensorData>(
      "sensor_topic", 10, std::bind(&SlamNode::sensorCallback, this, std::placeholders::_1));
      
    // Rest of the SLAM node code...
  }
  
private:
  void sensorCallback(const sensor_msgs::msg::SensorData::SharedPtr msg)
  {
    // Process the received sensor data
    // Update the map based on the sensor data
    
    // Add your sensor data processing and map update code here
  }
  
  rclcpp::Subscription<sensor_msgs::msg::SensorData>::SharedPtr sensor_subscription_;
};

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
  auto node = std::make_shared<SlamNode>();
  rclcpp::spin(node);
  rclcpp::shutdown();
  return 0;
}
```

In this code snippet, the `SlamNode` class has a member variable `sensor_subscription_` of type `rclcpp::Subscription` that represents the subscriber for the sensor topic. The subscriber is created in the `SlamNode` constructor using the `create_subscription` function. It takes the topic name, queue size, and a callback function as arguments. The callback function `sensorCallback` is called whenever a new message is received on the sensor topic.

Inside the `sensorCallback` function, you can process the received sensor data and update the map based on the sensor information. This is where you would implement the sensor data processing algorithms and incorporate the data into your SLAM algorithm.

Modify the code according to the specific sensor topic name and message type you are using. Also, add your sensor data processing and map update code inside the `sensorCallback` function to handle the received sensor data appropriately.
