To create a SLAM node in C++ for your ROS 2 package, you can follow the code snippet below:

```cpp
#include <rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp>

class SlamNode : public rclcpp::Node
{
public:
  SlamNode() : Node("slam_node")
  {
    // Initialize the SLAM node
    // Add any necessary initialization code here
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
  auto node = std::make_shared<SlamNode>();
  rclcpp::spin(node);
  rclcpp::shutdown();
  return 0;
}
```

In this code snippet, a `SlamNode` class is created by inheriting from the `rclcpp::Node` class provided by the `rclcpp` library. The constructor of the `SlamNode` class initializes the node with a name, in this case, "slam_node". You can add any necessary initialization code inside the constructor to set up the SLAM node.

The `main` function initializes the ROS 2 communication, creates an instance of the `SlamNode`, spins the node to process incoming messages, and then shuts down the ROS 2 communication when the node is done.

Please note that you may need to include additional headers and modify the code based on your specific SLAM implementation and requirements.
