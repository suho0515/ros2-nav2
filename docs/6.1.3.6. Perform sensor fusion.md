```cpp
void performSensorFusion()
{
  // Perform sensor fusion to combine sensor measurements

  // Iterate through the preprocessed sensor data
  for (const auto& sensor_data : preprocessed_sensor_data_)
  {
    // Perform sensor fusion for each sensor data

    // Get the sensor measurements from the sensor data
    const SensorMeasurements& measurements = sensor_data.measurements;

    // Perform sensor fusion algorithm based on the sensor measurements
    // Combine the measurements to obtain a fused sensor output

    // Update the fused sensor data with the fused output
    fused_sensor_data_.push_back(fused_output);
  }
}
```

In the code above, the `performSensorFusion` function performs sensor fusion to combine the sensor measurements from the preprocessed sensor data. It iterates through each preprocessed sensor data and retrieves the sensor measurements. Based on the specific sensor fusion algorithm, it combines the measurements to obtain a fused sensor output. The fused output is then added to the `fused_sensor_data_` vector.

You can customize the implementation of the sensor fusion algorithm based on your specific requirements and the types of sensor measurements involved.
