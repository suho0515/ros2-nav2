To handle robot movement and localization updates in the SLAM node, you need to subscribe to the odometry and localization topics and update the robot pose accordingly. Here's an example of how you can implement this in the SLAM node:

```cpp
#include <rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp>
#include <nav_msgs/msg/Odometry.hpp>
#include <geometry_msgs/msg/PoseStamped.hpp>

class SlamNode : public rclcpp::Node
{
public:
  SlamNode() : Node("slam_node")
  {
    // Create subscribers for odometry and localization updates
    odometry_subscription_ = this->create_subscription<nav_msgs::msg::Odometry>(
        "odom_topic", 10, std::bind(&SlamNode::odometryCallback, this, std::placeholders::_1));

    localization_subscription_ = this->create_subscription<geometry_msgs::msg::PoseStamped>(
        "localization_topic", 10, std::bind(&SlamNode::localizationCallback, this, std::placeholders::_1));

    // Initialize the robot pose
    robot_pose_.position.x = 0.0;
    robot_pose_.position.y = 0.0;
    robot_pose_.position.z = 0.0;
    robot_pose_.orientation.x = 0.0;
    robot_pose_.orientation.y = 0.0;
    robot_pose_.orientation.z = 0.0;
    robot_pose_.orientation.w = 1.0;
  }

private:
  void odometryCallback(const nav_msgs::msg::Odometry::SharedPtr msg)
  {
    // Update the robot pose based on odometry data
    robot_pose_ = msg->pose.pose;
  }

  void localizationCallback(const geometry_msgs::msg::PoseStamped::SharedPtr msg)
  {
    // Update the robot pose based on localization data
    robot_pose_ = msg->pose;
  }

  geometry_msgs::msg::Pose robot_pose_;
  rclcpp::Subscription<nav_msgs::msg::Odometry>::SharedPtr odometry_subscription_;
  rclcpp::Subscription<geometry_msgs::msg::PoseStamped>::SharedPtr localization_subscription_;
};

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
  auto node = std::make_shared<SlamNode>();
  rclcpp::spin(node);
  rclcpp::shutdown();
  return 0;
}
```

In this code snippet, the `SlamNode` class has two subscribers: `odometry_subscription_` for odometry updates and `localization_subscription_` for localization updates. Each subscriber has a corresponding callback function: `odometryCallback` and `localizationCallback`.

Inside the callback functions, the robot pose is updated based on the received odometry or localization data. In this example, the robot pose is stored in the `robot_pose_` member variable as a `geometry_msgs/Pose` message.

Modify the code according to your specific odometry and localization topics and message types. Update the robot pose based on the received data to ensure that the SLAM algorithm incorporates accurate robot movement and localization information.
