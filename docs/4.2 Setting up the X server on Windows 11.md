# 4.2 Setting up the X server on Windows 11

1. **Download VcXsrv:** Go to the VcXsrv website (https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) and download the latest version of the installer.

2. **Install VcXsrv:** Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard to install VcXsrv on your Windows 11 system. During the installation, you can choose the desired settings, such as whether to start VcXsrv automatically at system startup.

3. **Launch XLaunch:** After the installation, launch XLaunch from the Start menu or desktop shortcut. The VcXsrv configuration window, XLaunch, will appear. Open XLaunch from the Start menu or desktop shortcut.

4. **Select Display Settings:** In the XLaunch configuration window, you can adjust various display settings. The default settings should work fine for most cases, but you can customize them based on your preferences. Make sure the "Multiple Windows" option is selected.

5. **Choose "No client"** option: Under the "Client startup" section, select the "Start no client" option. This ensures that no specific client program is started automatically.

6. **Choose "Start a program" option (optional):** If you want to start a specific program automatically when launching VcXsrv, select the "Start a program" option under the "Client startup" section. Then, enter the command or path to the program in the input field provided.

7. **Enable Clipboard:** Under the "Additional parameters for VcXsrv" section, check the "Clipboard" option. This allows you to use the clipboard functionality between the Docker container and your Windows system.

8. **Enable Native OpenGL:** Under the "Additional parameters for VcXsrv" section, check the "Native OpenGL" option. This enables the use of native OpenGL libraries for improved performance when running OpenGL applications in the Docker container.

9. **Disable Access Control:** Under the "Additional parameters for VcXsrv" section, check the "Disable access control" option. This disables access control mechanisms, allowing any X client to connect to the X server.

10. **Adjust other settings (optional):** You can also adjust other display settings, such as the screen number and screen size, based on your requirements.

11. **Save Configuration:** Once you have made the desired settings adjustments, click the "Next" button to proceed.

12. **Save Configuration File:** On the following screen, choose whether to save the configuration as a configuration file or use the configuration directly. Select the desired option and click "Next" to continue.

13. **Finish the Setup:** Review the summary of your configuration settings and click the "Finish" button to complete the setup process.

Now, VcXsrv is configured with the "Start no client" or "Start a program" settings, clipboard enabled, native OpenGL enabled, and access control disabled. You can test running GUI applications in Docker containers and utilize the configured settings accordingly.
