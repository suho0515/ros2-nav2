In the code above, after receiving the sensor data in the `sensorCallback` function, the sensor data is passed to the `preprocessSensorData` function for preprocessing. Once the sensor data is preprocessed, the `extractFeatures` function is called to extract features from the preprocessed sensor data. You can implement your specific feature extraction algorithms or techniques in this function based on your sensor data.

After extracting the features, the `processExtractedFeatures` function is called to process the extracted features. This is where you can implement your logic or algorithms to further process or analyze the extracted features.

Feel free to modify the code to suit your feature extraction requirements and implement your own feature extraction techniques based on your sensor data.
