To verify the import of necessary libraries and packages in the SLAM node, you can perform the following test:

1. Compile the SLAM node source code using the appropriate build system (e.g., `colcon build`, `catkin_make`).
2. Ensure that the build process completes successfully without any error messages related to missing imports or library dependencies.
3. Run the SLAM node and observe the output in the terminal. If the node starts without any import-related errors, it indicates that the necessary libraries and packages have been successfully imported.
4. Additionally, you can check for any compilation warnings or errors related to missing headers or undefined symbols. Resolving these issues will further validate the correctness of the import statements.

By successfully building and running the SLAM node without any import-related errors or warnings, you can confirm that the necessary libraries and packages have been imported correctly for implementing the SLAM functionality.
